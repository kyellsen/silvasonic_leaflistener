# Notes for users
notes: |
  This is a high-frequency ultrasonic microphone capable of recording
  up to 192 kHz (Nyquist frequency at 384 kHz sample rate).

  Ideal for:
  - Bat echolocation calls (20-120 kHz)
  - Insect sounds
  - Ultrasonic environmental monitoring

  For bird detection with BirdNET, audio will be downsampled to 48 kHz
  during analysis. The high sample rate preserves ultrasonic content
  that may be useful for other analysis pipelines.

  USB Requirements:
  - USB 2.0 or higher for full 384 kHz bandwidth
  - Avoid USB hubs if possible for stable streaming
