# Silvasonic

**Comprehensive Bioacoustic Recording Station for Long-term Monitoring**

Silvasonic is a robust, autonomous bioacoustic monitoring device built on the Raspberry Pi 5 platform. Designed for long-term deployment (3+ years), it captures the entire soundscape—from singing birds to ultrasonic bat calls—ensuring data resilience and seamless synchronization with central servers.

Status: **Active Development**

## 💡 What is it?

Silvasonic transforms a Raspberry Pi 5 into a professional-grade acoustic recorder ("The Ear") and analyzer ("The Brain").

**Key Capabilities:**

- **The Ear**: Uninterrupted audio recording (Ultrasonic capable).
- **The Carrier**: Resilient upload/sync to cloud (Nextcloud, S3).
- **The Brain**: On-device analysis (BirdNET) for species classification.
- **The Face**: Interactive local Dashboard.
